### <a id="table01"></a>Table 1. Tax Freedom Day 2016

Calendar year 2016.

Tax Freedom Day is the day when the nation as a whole has earned enough money to pay off its total tax bill for the year. Tax Freedom Day provides Americans with an easy way to gauge the overall tax take-a task that can otherwise be daunting due to the multiplicity of taxes at various levels of government and "hidden" taxes and fees that are often buried in the cost of living. Tax Freedom Day computed by dividing total tax collections by the nation's income, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Every dollar that is officially called income by the government is counted, and every payment that is officially considered a tax is counted. The resulting percentage is then converted into days of a 365-day calendar year.

### <a id="table02"></a>Table 2. State-Local Tax Burdens

These data accompany the Tax Foundation's report [Annual State-Local Tax Burden Rankings FY 2012](http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-local-tax-burden-rankings-fy-2012) by [Liz Malm](http://taxfoundation.org/staff/liz-malm) [Nicole Kaeding](http:http://taxfoundation.org/staff/nicole-kaeding) and [Gerald Prante](http://www.lynchburg.edu/content/gerald-prante). They are the product of analyzing data from government and public policy sources. This report estimates the combined state and local tax burden shouldered by the residents of each of the fifty states, regardless of the jurisdictions to which those taxes are paid. The burden is calculated as the total taxes paid per capita by state residents to any tax jurisdiction divided by the per capita income of that state.

### <a id="table03"></a>Table 3. State Business Tax Climate Index

Rankings based on snapshot date of July 1, 2016.

The State Business Tax Climate Index compares states on over 100 different variables in five important areas of taxation (corporate taxes, individual income taxes, sales taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and property taxes) and then adding the results up to a final, overall ranking. This approach rewards states on particularly strong aspects of their tax systems (or penalizes them on particularly weak aspects) while also measuring the general competitiveness of their overall tax systems. The result is a score that can be compared to other states' scores.

A rank of 1 indicates the state's tax system is more favorable for business; a rank of 50 indicates the state's tax system is less favorable for business. Snapshot data is law as of July 1, 2014. Component rankings do not average to total. States without a given tax are ranked equally as number 1 in that component. D.C.'s rank does not affect other states' rankings, since it is not a state. The D.C. rank is only for reference purposes.

#### Notes on State Individual Income Tax Rates:

Brackets are for single taxpayers. Some states double bracket widths for joint filers (Ala., Ariz., Calif., Conn., Hawaii, Idaho, Kans., La., Nebr., Ore.). N.Y. doubles all except the 6.85% bracket. Some states increase but do not double brackets for joint filers (Ga., Maine, Minn., N.M., N.D., Okla., R.I., Vt., Wis.). Md. increases some but not all brackets. N.J. adds a 2.45% rate and doubles some bracket widths. Consult TaxFoundation.org for tables for joint filers and married filing separately.

#### Notes

In addition to regular corporate income taxes, many states impose other taxes on corporations such as gross receipts taxes and franchise taxes. Some states also impose an alternative minimum tax and special rates on financial institutions. These are not included here.

Arkansas has a "benefit recapture," by which corporations with more than $100,000 of taxable income pay a flat tax of 6.5% on all income, not just on amounts above the benefit threshold.

Connecticut's rate includes a 20% surtax, which effectively increases the rate from 7.5% to 9%. Surtax is required by businesses with at least $100 million annual gross income.

Nevada, Ohio, Texas, and Washington do not have a corporate income tax but do have a gross receipts tax with rates not strictly comparable to corporate income tax rates. See Table 18 for more information. Delaware and Virginia have a gross receipts tax in addition to the corporate income tax.

Illinois' rate includes two separate corporate income taxes, one at a 5.25% rate and one at a 2.5% rate.

The tax rate in Indiana will decrease to 6% on July 1, 2017.

In New Jersey, corporations with entire net income greater than $100,000 pay 9% on all taxable income, companies with entire net income greater than $50,000 and less than or equal to $100,000 pay 7.5% on all taxable income, and companies with entire net income less than or equal to $50,000 pay 6.5% on all taxable income.

The tax rate in New Mexico will decrease to 5.9% in 2018.

### <a id="table18"></a>Table 18. State Gross Receipts Taxes

January 1, 2017

Gross receipts taxes are complex business taxes imposed at a low rate but on a wide base of transactions, resulting in high effective tax rates that can vary by industry. These taxes often include minimum tax liabilities that can result in much higher effective rates for some small businesses.

This summary data is impractical for data analysis and has been excluded from the set of data. The summary table is reproduced below:

State      | Name of Tax                                           | Range of Rates
:--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :-------------
Delaware   | Manufacturers' & Merchants' License Tax               | 0.0945% - 0.7468%
Nevada     | Commerce Tax                                          | 0.0051%-.331
Ohio       | Commercial Activities Tax (CAT)                       | 0.26%
Texas      | Margin Tax                                            | 0.331% - 0.75%
Virginia   | Business/Professional/Occupational License Tax (BPOL) | 0.02% - 0.58%
Washington | Business & Occupation Tax (B&O)                       | 0.13% - 3.3%

#### Note

Virginia's tax is locally levied and rates vary by business and jurisdiction. Approximately half of counties do not levy the tax. Some counties instead levy a capital stock tax.

#### Notes

City, county, and municipal rates vary. These rates are weighted by population to compute an average local tax rate.

Three states levy mandatory, statewide, local add-on sales taxes at the state level: California (1%), Utah (1.25%), and Virginia (1%). We include these in their state sales taxes.

The sales taxes in Hawaii, New Mexico, and South Dakota have broad bases that include many business-to-business services.

Due to data limitations, the table does not include sales taxes in local resort areas in Montana.

Some counties in New Jersey are not subject to statewide sales tax rates and collect a local rate of 3.5%. Their average local score is represented as a negative.

`otherTax`  | Other taxes in dollars applied per gallon of gasoline.

#### Notes

The [American Petroleum Institute](http://www.api.org/) (API) has developed a methodology for determining the average tax rate on a gallon of fuel. Rates may include any of the following: excise taxes, environmental fees, storage tank taxes, other fees or taxes, and general sales taxes. In states where gasoline is subject to the general sales tax, or where the fuel tax is based on the average sale price, the average rate determined by API is sensitive to changes in the price of gasoline. California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and New York fully or partially apply general sales taxes to the purchase of gasoline.

:-------- | :---------- | :------------------
Class A   | 100% Exempt | 0%
Class C   | $25,000     | 11% - 16%

Class B beneficiaries are non-immediate family members. Class C beneficiaries are non-family members. For inheritance taxes, unlike estate taxes, the term “exemption” applies to the size of the gift itself, not the total size of the estate.
